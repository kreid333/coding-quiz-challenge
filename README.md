# Project Title

Creating a quiz using Javascript

## Description

For this project, I had to create a functional quiz app that dynamically changed the content of the page with each button click.

## Getting Started

### Installing

No files are required to access this project. However, I would suggest that you go in Git Bash (or any other terminal you use), pull all files within the "gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020-u-c" repo, go to the "02-Homework" folder within "04-Web-APIs", and copy the "README.md" (for referencing what you are suppose to be doing).

### Executing program

Open HTML file in a browser to view how it looks visually and to see how it operates. I would recommend using console.log() in your Javascript file to see what your code is doing.
