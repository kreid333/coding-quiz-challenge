# Coding Quiz Challenge


## Description 

For this project, I had to create a functional quiz app that dynamically changed the content of the page with each button click. At the end of the quiz the user will have the opportunity to save their highscore, which will then be displayed on the highscores page.

## Table of Contents

## Usage 

In order to access this application, the user can click on the link below, which will redirect them to my Coding Quiz Challenge application.

* [Coding Quiz Challenge](https://kreid333.github.io/coding-quiz-challenge/)

From there, the user can start the quiz, and 75 second timer, by clicking the "Start Quiz". If a question is wrong, 15 seconds will be deducted from the timer; if they are right, no time will be deducted from the timer. Once the user reaches the "All Done!" page, they can enter their initials, which will be displayed on the "View Highscores" page along with what time they finished the quiz at, according to the timer.
